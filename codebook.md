#Codebook describing the variables

Accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals,acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals. (t) stand for time
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ

Body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived to obtain Jerk signal
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ

Magnitude of the three-dimensional signals calculated using the Euclidean norm
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag

Frequency domain signals (f) stands for Frequency
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
