#Codebook describing the variables

##Subject ID
The ID number assigned to a particular subject who's accelerometer data was collected.

##Activity
The activity performed by a particular subject.

##Accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals,acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals. (t) stands for time.
tBodyAcc-XYZ;
tGravityAcc-XYZ.

##Body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived to obtain Jerk signal.
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ;
tBodyGyro-XYZ;
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ;

##Magnitude of the three-dimensional signals calculated using the Euclidean norm.
tBodyAccMag;
tGravityAccMag;
tBodyAccJerkMag;
tBodyGyroMag;
tBodyGyroJerkMag.

##Frequency domain signals, (f) stands for Frequency.
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

##The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value;
std(): Standard deviation;
